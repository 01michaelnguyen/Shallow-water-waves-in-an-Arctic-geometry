# Shallow-water-waves-in-a-two-and-N-basin-geometry
This code visualises (linear) Shallow-water waves in time going around a two-basin geometry reminiscent to a simple Arctic Ocean model. 

This code also permits waves travelling to N-basin geometries also. Below are some plots from a two-basin geometry moving in time t=0, T/3, 2T/3, where T is the period of the wave (the time taken for the wave to make one cycle to its original position around the basin). Here is the fastest mode for a two-basin geometry $\omega=0.2154$, i.e. the time period for a wave to make one circuit around the wave:
